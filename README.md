# Pixels_And_Duck
A program for learning about sequencing instructions designed for children 6 through 8

![Duck and pixels](/logo.gif?raw=true "duck and pixels")

# Design Goals
The main objective is to give students an understanding of sequencing instructions.

-target ages 6 through 10

-instructions use simple symbols

-include concepts like **if** and **loop** structures

-be cute enough to generate interest

-be complete and functional enough for students to develop some sense of mastery

-students can work freeform or with guided examples (the built-in examples are currently not great) 

# Technology
This is developed with the simple Processing 4.0 JAVA IDE. If you would like to move it to a different IDE like IntelliJ, that can be done. If you would like to port it to another language, Javascript or Python would be the best options. The code is currently a **mess**. See the section on history for more on that. 

# History
Young students had great difficulty understanding the connection between instructions and their effect and sequence. So I started this project as a complete environment where I could base a semester-long class around once a week. Students generally enjoy this environment, and most students reach the learning outcomes I set for them.

I'm sorry about the state of the code. This project was designed and created entirely between lessons as a teacher and course developer. Hence my already sloppy coding practices were worse than usual. This project was made to meet the needs of my students and their lessons as needed.
